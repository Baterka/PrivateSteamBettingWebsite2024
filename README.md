# Free alternative
I am offering a free alternative for betting website:
https://github.com/Baterka/CSGOHunt.com-Copy

Before you use it:
 - This is code was not updated for 6 years
 - Source code started as a leak of website CSGOHunt.com
   - It uses frontend code of that website (from that era)
   - It uses somehow personal backend, but very outdated and poorly written
 - I do not provide any support for it
 - I will not actively work on this source code
 - To sum it up: **It is provided as is without zero help from my side**
